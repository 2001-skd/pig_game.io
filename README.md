## 💡 About the Game

In this game, two players take turns to roll a dice. Each player can roll the dice as many times as they want in a turn and accumulate their current score. However, if they roll a 1, their current score resets and it's the next player's turn. A player can choose to "Hold" to add the current score to their total score. The first player to reach the target score (e.g. 10) wins the game.
